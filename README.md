## utils

utils for Ouster OSX sensors and more.

## subvoxelmap

Subvoxelmap implementation from *3D Monte Carlo Localization with Efficient Distance Field Representation for Automated Driving in Dynamic Environments*

## fastsense_map

Subvoxelmap implementation from *3D Monte Carlo Localization with Efficient Distance Field Representation for Automated Driving in Dynamic Environments*, mixed with fastsense's local map implementation

## loam

LOAM-specific packages

## registration

### dca

Implementation of [ICP registration with DCA descriptor for 3D point clouds](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-13-20423&id=451928), missing:

* GICP with selected features, currently in use: standard ICP

## registration

### icp

ICP with

* Gauss Newton (Point-based/Plane-based)
* Levenberg-Marquard (Point-based/Plane-based)

## CUDA

CUDA introduction with *CUDA C Programming - John Cheng, Max Grossmann, Ty McKercher*

Experiments with CUDA-accelerated LOAM-based feature registration.

Code based on [official additional material from WROX](https://github.com/deeperlearning/professional-cuda-c-programming)
